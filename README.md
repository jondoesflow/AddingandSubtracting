# Adding and Subtracting Canvas App
A standalone Power Apps Canvas App to help children in Year 1 count and subtract

# Introduction

My daughter is at Year 1 in school and is currently tasked with counting in 2s, 5s, and being able to add or subtract 1 from any number between 1 and 99. I decided to create an canvas app to help her with her computer literacy as well as being able to improve her maths.

# Installation

Download the ZIP file from this repo, go to https://make.powerapps.com and click on Solutions, Import Solution, browse to the ZIP file and follow the on screen prompts

# Canvas app components

There is only one component in this unmanaged solution and that is the canvas app itself. I wanted to keep it pretty basic, but it also gave me the chance to use neumorphic buttons that Kristine Kolodziejski uses in her Extreme Makeover YouTube video here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3PEKjpdqOM

## Home Screen

From the home screen, you can either go to the Find the Number, Count in 2s or Count in 5s screens.

##Find the Number

From the find the number screen, you can press the refresh button to randomly set a mathematical question, and change whether you want to minus or add 1 to another number by pressing the - or + buttons. When you want to make a guess, click on the Find the Number button to be taken to a 0 - 100 grid.  

Click the number to submit your answer:

If you get the question wrong, a popup appears telling you to try again and you are presented with the question again to make another choice, clicking OK will take you back to the grid:

When you get it correct, you are presented with a popup tell you, you are correct, clicking OK will take you back to the previous page to try another addition/subtraction question:

On loading the Count in 2s screen, you are asked to put in a number that is 2 more than 2.  If you put any other number other than 4 in, the next box will not appear.

Here you can count in 2s up to 30.
